// Variables in C
// A variable is like a labeled box where you can store data. Imagine you have a box labeled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. In C, you would do this by writing int age = 25;. This means you're storing the number 25 in the variable named age.

// int denotes that we will be storing integers (numbers) in this variable.

// Here's the cool part: whenever you use age in your code, C will remember it is 25. For example, if you write printf("%d", age), C will show 25.

// Task
// Create a variable in editor named age and assign the value 25 to it.
// Print the value of age variable using print statement.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Replace __ with 25
    int age = 25;
    printf("%d", age);
}
#include <stdio.h>
